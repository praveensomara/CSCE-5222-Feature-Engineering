But after a decade of splashy announcements and enormous investments from Silicon Valley’s most influential organizations, few people understand the dichotomy between the idea and its execution better than Mohamed Elshenawy. As senior vice president of engineering teams at autonomous vehicle company Cruise, he spends his working life neck-deep in the challenges that come from building a self-driving car.  \n","\n","“One of the common questions I get asked by friends and family is, ‘Why does it take so long to solve the self-driving problem?’” \n","\n","The answer? \n","\n","“We aren’t teaching a human brain, which has already evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to accurately perceive the world and predict actions within their surroundings. We are essentially building an AV brain that can do all that without stagnating or making silly mistakes or getting tired, bored or distracted. In order to do that, we’re compressing hundreds of thousands of years of human intelligence into just a few years.”\n","\n","While some self-driving contenders have opted to test their technology on quieter roads in the hopes of solving “easier” driving conditions before venturing into complex urban driving, Cruise has jumped straight into the deep end — in this case, the hilly streets of its hometown.

Whilst at one point adaptive cruise control may have been considered an excessive option, many new car buyers now view it as essential. Features such as lane keep / change assist were considered revolutionary when they first appeared on the Tesla Model S in late 2014, but are now commonplace. With all these rapid developments in self-driving tech a lot of people believe it is only a matter of time before all cars on the road are driving and communicating solely by themselves, and research firm IDTechEx agrees.\n","\n","In a new report dubbed “Autonomous Cars, Robotaxis & Sensors 2022-2042” IDTechEx delves deep into the future of automated mobility. The company states self-driving vehicles are not distracted by things which may influence humans, such as fellow drivers or mobile phones. The firm also reckons 5G connectivity will ensure self-driving vehicles receive more real-time information about their surroundings than a human could ever process.\n","\n","IDTechEx believes with current developments we could see autonomous vehicles matching or exceeding human safety levels by as soon as 2024. If growth is sustained, the report suggests by 2046 self-driving vehicles could meet the total mobility demand of the US – 3 trillion miles per annum. Then by 2050 autonomous vehicles could theoretically meet the entire transport needs of the world, with less than one accident per year. At this point, IDTechEx expects in many countries human driving on public roads will be outlawed in order to prevent injury, accidents and interference with self-driving vehicles that are all communicating amongst themselves.\n","\n","The main problem IDTechEx forecasts however is not the continued development and improvement of autonomous tech, but regulation. Regulators could be potential barriers to progress, with IDTechEx identifying Tesla’s loss of its top safety rating from the NHTSA for the Model 3 and Y as a key example.  Tesla removed radar from both vehicles in May in an effort to improve their autonomous systems with less interference, however the NHTSA believed both cars were safer with it – going against Tesla’s expertise, data and research.\n","\n","Regardless, the coming years will certainly be interesting. The auto industry as a whole is reaching a new electric and autonomous era, and rapidly leaving the ways of the past behind. What will come of classic and enthusiast cars and their drivers in this forthcoming period? Perhaps certain “unregulated” routes may exist far from cities and civilization, or else they could just be restricted to driving on race tracks – but that’s all just speculation on my own behalf.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","predict_from_text(text)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The predicted category using the SVM model is Autonomous vehicles.\n","The conditional probability is: 99.99114809850987\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vmQMNKEzGGaW","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630883391303,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":323,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Pujari","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg1I3G9BMqT1pluoDvZFTn8_BCzn-r6SSs7jgt4qA=s64","userId":"05634372435003585479"}},"outputId":"4fb48890-c9bc-44e4-97c3-cc2e0db35e27"},"source":["# Space Travel\n","\n","text = \"\"\"\n","Axios' \"How it Happened: The Next Astronauts\" podcast follows the first all-civilian space crew as they prepare for their historic mission. \n","\n","The launch next month of the first all-civilian mission to orbit is an ambitious test for a burgeoning space industry's futuristic dream of sending many more ordinary people to space in the next few years.\n","\n","Why it matters: Companies and nations envision millions of people living and working in space without having to become professional, government-backed astronauts. Those hopes are riding on SpaceX's next crewed mission, called Inspiration4.\n","\n","Previous launches have taken billionaires to suborbital space or sent space tourists to the International Space Station alongside professional astronauts, but this mission is the first with a crew made up entirely of amateur astronauts.\n","What's happening: Inspiration4 is effectively a proof of concept for the idea that an all-civilian mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft — and ostensibly that all-amateur spaceflight — can work.\n","\n","Four crewmembers — Jared Isaacman, Sian Proctor, Chris Sembroski and Hayley Arceneaux — will launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sept. 15.\n","They will orbit the Earth for about three days, flying higher than the International Space Station and Hubble Space Telescope before coming in for a splashdown off the Florida coast.\n","During their mission, the crew will live in close quarters, stare down at Earth and at the stars, perform science experiments and keep an eye on how their spacecraft is performing while mission controllers monitor it from the ground.\n","The big picture: SpaceX wants space travel one day to be akin to air travel so that anyone who wants to can fly to orbit or far-off parts of space.\n","\n","\"We'd like to see aircraft like — airline, like — operations from a human spaceflight perspective, and so this chance to have our first commercial all-civilian flight is awesome,\" SpaceX director of human spaceflight Benji Reed told me.\n","Yes, but: Flying to space isn't anything like flying on a commercial airliner, at least not yet.\n","\n","It's taken this crew months of training in locations around the U.S. to get ready for their launch, and it has dominated their lives since the full crew was announced in March.\n","The four crewmembers have effectively gotten a crash course in astronaut training, spending time in simulators, studying reams of notes on their own time and taking quizzes from SpaceX.\n","While they may not be professionals, they will certainly not be like a typical airline passenger when they fly to space in September.

And the outlook for the future is equally bleak – and that includes Spain, a country that is famed for the positive effects of its supposedly Mediterranean diet.\n","\n","An investigation by the Mar de Barcelona hospital has found that 80% of men and 55% of women will be overweight by 2030. If the current trend continues, the researchers write, within 11 years more than 27 million people in Spain will be overweight.\n","\n","Being overweight can mean a higher risk of suffering a number of diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, stroke and cancer\n","\n","The study, published in the Spanish Cardiology Magazine, points out that this epidemic will mean costs of €3 billion for the country’s health system.\n","\n","The issue, the experts state, is not an esthetic one, but rather a question of health. Being overweight can mean a higher risk of suffering a number of diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancer and other cardiovascular conditions.\n","\n","Researchers at the Barcelona hospital revised all of the scientific literature published in Spain on epidemiology and the prevalence of obesity and excess weight between 1987 and 2014 in order to come up with an accurate picture of the state of the country’s residents. “We found the trends and we cross-referenced them with data covering the general population from the National Statistics Institute in order to estimate the figures of obesity and excess weight,” explains Álvaro Hernáez, the chief researcher on the project. The results revealed an “alarming future.”\n","\n","There are currently 25 million people with excess weight, three million more than a decade ago\n","\n","DR ALBERT GODAY, AUTHOR OF THE STUDY\n","\n","“There are currently 25 million people with excess weight, three million more than a decade ago,” explains Dr Albert Goday, another author of the study. “In a conservative scenario, if this trend continues, there will be another three million more – 16% more cases – by 2030.”\n","\n","“In men, excess weight is more usual up to the age of 50,” explains Goday. “From 50 onward, obesity rises among women. These are issues that are intrinsically linked to hormonal metabolism. From a certain age, it is harder for women to control their weight.”\n","\n","The experts argue that any weight loss, no matter how small, reduces the risk of contracting one of the associated illnesses. “We aren’t going to find the key to this or a vaccination overnight,” Goday adds. “But any minor intervention will help to reduce the risk. You might think that you have made a huge effort and have only lost four kilos when you need to lose many more, but you must bear in mind that those four kilos are already reducing the risk.”\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","predict_from_text(text)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The predicted category using the SVM model is Coronavirus.\n","The conditional probability is: 89.98738387356995\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"scT5eTlKGGaY","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630883629287,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":198,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Pujari","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg1I3G9BMqT1pluoDvZFTn8_BCzn-r6SSs7jgt4qA=s64","userId":"05634372435003585479"}},"outputId":"8070db56-5771-4937-a164-b3323f094564"},"source":["# Animal abuse\n","\n","text = \"\"\"\n","Spain’s animal rights party PACMA posted a 38-second video on Twitter on Friday showing a man freeing a fox from a cage, before hunters immediately start shooting at it.\n","\n","“Hunters shut what appears to be a fox in a cage and let it out only to pepper it with bullets,” says the accompanying text. “Another ‘isolated case’ as the hunting lobby refers to it.
